## Introduction
This repository contains projects ranging from basic machine learning algorithms to advanced concepts. The objective is to explore, understand, and implement machine learning techniques using Python.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **Projects/**: Contains project-specific folders.
- **Datasets/**: Stores datasets used in various projects.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- **Scripts/**: Python scripts for automated tasks.
  
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumit-nalavade/MACHINE-LEARNING.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd MACHINE-LEARNING
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.

## Projects
### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Implementation and evaluation of linear regression models.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification using logistic regression.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**: Clustering data into groups based on features.
- **PCA**: Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis.

## Dependencies
The projects require the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `tensorflow` (for deep learning projects)
